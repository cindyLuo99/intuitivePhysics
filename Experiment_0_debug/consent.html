            Dear Participants,
        </p>
        <!-- <p align=left>
            Thank you for your interest! In this study, you'll watch videos where a ball hits a triangle behind a screen. You'll then need to guess where the ball hits the triangle. The study is expected to take about 15 minutes.
        </p> -->
        <p align=left>
            You are being asked to participate in a project being conducted by a research team at Harvard University, under the direction of Dr. Tomer Ullman. 
        We are interested in how people are able to reason quickly and in a commonsense way about the different objects and people they encounter in the world around them. 
        A better understanding of commonsense reasoning has implications for building more intelligent machines that can reason in a more human-like way, lowering risk in different physical situations. 
        During this study, you will see 72 brief animations of moving balls with parts of their movements hidden by a screen, and after each animation you will click-and-drag a triangle to where you think the ball hit the triangle behind the screen. 
        </p>

            The study will last around 15 minutes. Your participation in this study is completely voluntary. You may refuse
            to participate, or you may choose to withdraw from participation at any time, without penalty or loss of benefit
            to which you are otherwise entitled. There has been no harm to people involved in this study and there are no risks
            associated with participation.
        </p>

            All information collected from the study will be associated with a Prolific Subject ID. Only researchers associated with this project will
            have access to the data. In order to make a research transparent to the scientific and broader community our study
            design and unidentifiable data might be made publicly available on Open Science Framework, a network of research
            materials and collaboration software, but your data will not be in anyway identifiable.
        </p>
        <p align=left>
            We will also provide you with a demographic questionnaire. The form does not include any personal identifying
            information other than your Prolific Subject ID. Your contribution to this questionnaire is voluntary;
            if you choose to provide the requested information, your responses will be confidential. You will be reimbursed
            at a rate of $12/hr for your participation.
        </p>
